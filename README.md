You can change the links that you want for the GUI, by just adding the url, into the code, if the app you want to use is a microsoft app, then you will need to add the microsoft service path to it instead as an url obiously doesnt exist for that app, as you are doing that you will need to add your own photos aswell so just create a folder or add the images to the folder as to which you have stored your .py file in. :)))))
